  		Hi, my name is Aaron and I live in The Big Apple. I'm a young guy who works as a project manager in construction, but has always felt that he can do alot more with himself. That's when I decided I want to take up coding. I'm starting with front end web development, and I'm working my way to the back. One day I'm going to backpack across South America. When I'm done maybe I'll start a graphic design firm. Either that or I'll try to link construction and coding, however that works. Either way, I'm about to make it big.
